== Goals

// [NOTE]
// ====
// Goals are "needs of the target organization, which the system will address". 
// While the development team is the principal user of the other books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all stakeholders (see {Handbook}).

// It must contain enough information to provide â€” if read just by itself â€” a general sketch of the entire project. 
// To this effect, chapter G.3 presents a short overview of the system and <<G1,G.1>> will typically include some key properties of the environment. 
// As it addresses a wide readership, it should be clear and minimize the use of specialized technical terms. 
// Together, <<G1,G.1>>, <<G2,G.2>> and <<G3,G.3>> describe the rationale for the project. 
// It is important to state these justifications explicitly. 
// Typically, they are well understood at the start of the project, but management and priorities can change  (see {Handbook}).
// ====

[[G1]]
=== G.1 Context and overall objectives

// NOTE: High-level view of the project: organizational context and reason for building a system (see {Handbook}).

// WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

// Example of numbered requirement (see <<g1-exp2, another example>>).
// //---- 

// //---- Requirement

// //---- 

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp1]]
^`G.1.{counter:g1}`^

//---- 

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp2]]
^`G.1.{counter:g1}`^
The {BAL} will allow the end user to get the content of the received mails at any given point in time and at any given place.

The system shall not be able to read any letter that is not a standard A4 letter.
//----

//---- Requirement
