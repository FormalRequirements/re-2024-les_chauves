### Requirements BAL-3k

## Install

sudo bash ./bin/install.sh
```

## Generate doc

```sh
bash ./bin/generate.sh
```

## Approach

After analysing different solutions, we came to the conclusion that **asciidoc** was the best suited one for our needs : generation on the fly, variables, easy to edit (i.e. easy to integrate/manipulate)

## Current status

* Goals Book is defined
* Environment Book is started
* Everything else is not started (we are behind schedule, sorry about that)
